Sequencer

<&recipe>In some situations it can be useful to produce a sequence of different redstone signals in a specific order, for example to control the different stages of some complex process. The sequencer serves as a simple solution to this problem.
The sequence of signals is encoded on a punched tape, each character is interpreted as a signal depending on the mode. The default mode is §lcompact mode§r. Here the character is interpreted as 8 digital signals, which are emitted on the same colors as in the <link;controlengineering:keypunch;keypunch>. Using a switch on the back the machine can be switched to §lanalog mode§r. In this mode the 4 least significant bits determine the signal color, while the 4 most significant bits determine the signal strength on this signal. All other signals will be equal to 0.
A <link;controlengineering:clocks;clock module> determines when the machine should switch to the next character. At the end of the tape it emits a redstone signal from the tape side and automatically resets to the start. This behavior can be disabled with a switch at the back in the rare cases where this is not desired.
